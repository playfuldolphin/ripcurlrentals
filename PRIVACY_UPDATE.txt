PRIVACY UPDATE - ADDRESSES PROTECTED
================================================================================

✓ ADDRESSES REMOVED FROM PUBLIC VIEW

Date: November 26, 2025
Security: Addresses now shared only after booking

================================================================================
WHAT CHANGED
================================================================================

BEFORE:
- Full street address visible on website
- Jacksonville Beach: 843 13th Ave S, Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250

AFTER:
- General location only shown publicly
- Jacksonville Beach: "South Jacksonville Beach, FL"
- St. Augustine: "St. Augustine, FL"

✓ Property descriptions now state:
  "Exact address provided after booking confirmation."

================================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS
================================================================================

✓ Protects your property from unwanted visitors
✓ Prevents address sharing before commitment
✓ Standard practice for vacation rentals
✓ Guests still know the general area
✓ Exact location shared once booking is confirmed

This is a best practice used by Airbnb, VRBO, and all major
vacation rental platforms.
